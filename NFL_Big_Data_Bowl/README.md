## some review about the competition 

- replace S feature with 10*Dis both for 2017 and 2018 (Data cleansing)
- using CNN architecture / x-axis 10 offensive players, y-axis defensive players, features on channels (1st place solution)
- can augment the data by flipping the coordinates of the players (when using CNN)
- stable CV strategy (seed averaging is necessary for neural network)
  - 5-fold GroupKFold on GameId, but in validation folds only consider data from 2018 (2018 dataset is more similar to 2019)
- going deeper, SE-module, residual networks didn't work (simple works best sometimes)
