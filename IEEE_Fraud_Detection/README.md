시간이 없어서 제대로 참가 못해 아쉬움이 많이 남는 대회다. 뒤늦게나마 대회 전반적인 것들을 정리해보고자 한다. **upvote 수가 낮다고 해서 중요하지 않은 커널은 절대 아니다**. 최소한으로 봐야 하는 것들만 정리해봤다.

## some review about the competition 

- according to 1st place solution, the key to this competition is finding **Fraudulent Clients** (to predict unseen clients that are not in the train dataset) which means **time is not the most feature.**

- **steady EDA** and **finding some magic features** is most important in machine learning competition.

- how to find UIDs is explained [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/discussion/111510), code provided [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-uid-detection-v6) and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/xgb-fraud-with-magic-0-9600)

- how the magic feature works is explained [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/discussion/111453)
